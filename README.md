Hi! My name is [@hongweibing](https://habitica.com/profile/d5edea78-6f44-43d6-83ef-fc9da1cbcae2) 

Daily Surprise is your personal generator of new impressions. Simply create a bank of small (or big!) challenges you'd like to try, and our app will randomly throw you one per day. This is not about productivity. This is about variety.

I am a big fan of Habitica, and I am trying to make the experience of using it even better. On [this page](https://storm-girdle-c18.notion.site/Useful-tools-for-Habitica-26486e08ea8a80f791bbd192356d3c6c), I will post useful scripts, utilities, apps and other materials that may be useful to you. If you have any ready-made materials or ideas, you can write to me.

You can also give me a couple of gems if you find these materials useful :) But this is not necessary. The main thing is to develop yourself and achieve your goals! 

Good luck!
